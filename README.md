# The Funny Guy RPG

You've heard us talkin' about it... here it is. Built on the RPG Maker 2003 engine for maximum novelty value and coolness, this is a game you won't want to miss. Even if you have no idea what an RPG is, I have no doubt you'll enjoy yourself. It pokes fun at classic RPGs like Final Fantasy, and even other RPG Maker 2003 games. Help Funny Guy find his brothers and team up against the hordes of Humorless and their elite masters... the Evilies themselves!

## Frequently Asked Questions

For those of you who don't know what an FAQ is, here's a definition for you... FAQ: A list of frequently asked questions and their answers about a given subject. With that said, let's move on!

### How do you start the game?

You start the FGRPG by clicking on either of the two shortcuts generated during the installation. One is in the Start Menu, under Programs → FGComics → The Funny Guy RPG. The second is on your computer's desktop. If you wish to start the RPG manually (for whatever reason), go to {HARD DRIVE} → Program Files → FGComics → FGRPG v.1.0.4 → RPG_RT.exe.

### The FGRPG isn't displaying correctly on my monitor (edges are cut off, etc.)!

The FGRPG was tested in a screen resolution of 1024x768. All three modes of display work fine in that resolution. If your monitor has a different resolution (1280x1024, 800x600, or (God forbid) 640x480), you may want to try changing the display mode.

### I'm stuck at [place in game]!

Before anything else, I just want to say don't dog me with emails that say something like "Help me!", etc (you will get an email back with a link to the forums). Go to the FGComics Forums and post a topic with your problem. You should recieve a reply from someone other than me within 24 hours. If ABSOLUTELY no one replies to your topic for more than 4 days, you may Private Message (PM) me (Elemental) on the forums.

### I found a glitch!

Report it online at the official FGRPG glitch topic in the FGComics Forums. Once I feel like doing it, I'll fix the glitch you found (if I find it too, and if it's fixable) and release a new FGRPG version (I use the versioning format x.y.z, which is the Linux kernel versioning system. Letter X is for huge, complete overhauls [The FGRPG 2 would be FGRPG 2.0.0], y is for major updates, and z is for small glitch fixes [the next glitch fix for this version of the FGRPG would be version 1.0.5]) for users to download and replace the old version of their FGRPG.

### When running the game, everything acts laggy.

That is because the program is running a lot of events at one time. Try closing other programs and switching to full-screen mode (F4). If that doesn't work, your computer probably doesn't have enough memory (RAM) to support games. Try running the FGRPG on another computer or buying more RAM.
